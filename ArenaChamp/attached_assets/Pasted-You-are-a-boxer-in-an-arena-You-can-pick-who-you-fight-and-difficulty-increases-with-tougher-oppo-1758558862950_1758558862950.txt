You are a boxer in an arena.

You can pick who you fight, and difficulty increases with tougher opponents.

Mike Tyson is the final boss, appearing as a huge fighter.

Each new fighter unlocks only after defeating the previous fighter.

Arrow keys = move your fighter.

Controls:

D = Jab (small knockback, fast)

F = Cross (medium damage)

S = Uppercut (big knockback, strong)

A = Block

W = Dodge

E = Duck

Health bars for both fighters are displayed on top.

Taking hits drains your health bar. Knocking out your opponent requires reducing their health to zero.

Punches only connect if fighters are close (proper range detection).

Every opponent has progressively higher health and punching power.

Tougher opponents deal more damage per hit.

Fighters (player + opponents) are represented as people icons/avatars (not just blocks).

Opponent AI includes:

Blocking, dodging, ducking.

Attacking strategically.

Learning and adapting to your attack patterns.

A chance to stun the player or opponent for 3 seconds (no actions during stun).

Add a small delay/cooldown on all attacks to prevent button mashing. (e.g., Jab = fast cooldown, Uppercut = longer cooldown).

Remove any central barrier so both fighters can move freely in the ring.

Knockback physics: light knockback for jabs, heavy knockback for uppercuts.

Player earns $5 after each win.

Upgrades menu lets you spend money to improve:

Speed (movement + punch speed)

Strength (attack power)

Chin (reduces stun chance)

Health (max health bar)

Upgrades cost scaling: starts at $1, increases by +$2 each purchase.

Upgrades stack, with 10 levels per stat max.

Opponents are progressively tougher, with higher HP, stronger punches, faster reaction time, and better strategy.

The Mike Tyson boss fight: huge sprite, max health, max power, hardest AI.

Knockdown mechanic: if health reaches zero, fighter falls with a short KO animation.

Round timer: if time runs out, fighter with more health wins.

Energy/Stamina bar: frequent attacks reduce stamina, lowering punch effectiveness until recovered.

Opponent AI acts on a timed interval (e.g., every 300ms) instead of spamming, to keep fights balanced.

Start/reset buttons and a fighter selection menu are included.

Game loop uses requestAnimationFrame with a clear update() + render() separation.

Fighters cannot move outside the arena (movement clamped to canvas edges).

Save/load progress (money, upgrades, unlocked opponents) via localStorage.

Add punch/block/dodge sound effects and simple crowd cheer sound effects.

Small punch animations (arms move or emoji fists ðŸ¥Š).
